    <footer>8.76 India’s agri-exports can be divided into three broad categories, i.e. export of <br>
        a) raw products<br>b) semi raw products <br>c) processed and ready-to-eat products. <br>
        Raw products exported are essentially of low value high volume nature, while semi processed products are of intermediate value and limited volume and processed ready-to-eat products are of high value but low volume nature. The major agri- exports of India are cereals (mostly rice - Basmati and non-Basmati), spices, cashew, oilcake/meals,tobacco, tea,coffee and marine products. Value of agri-exports to total exports of the country has been ranging between 15 to 20 per cent. Whereas marine products export has exhibited some uptrend, this advantage was more than offset by sharp decline in export prices of soya meal which of late has been a major export item. 
        8.77 India’s agri-exports face certain constraints that arise from conflicting domestic policies relating to production, storage, distribution, food security, pricing concerns etc. Unwillingness to decide on basic minimum quantities for export makes Indian supply sources unreliable. Higher domestic prices in comparison to international prices of products of bulk exports like sugar,wheat, rice etc. make our exports commercially less competitive. Market intelligence and creating awareness in international market about quality of products need to be strengthened to boost agricultural exports.
        Agri-Imports:
        8.78 Agri-imports constitute only a small proportion of the country’s total imports. During the period 1996-97 to 1999-2000, agri-imports havebeenintherangeof4to7percentofthe total imports of the country. In recent years, edible oil has become the single largest agri- import accounting for more than 50 per cent of the value of total agri-imports. In 1999 -2000, it accounted for as high as 70 per cent of total agri-imports. Another item, which has been accounting for around 10 per cent of total agri- imports is raw cashewnut. Each of the other agricultural and allied products imported into the country - cereals, pulses, spices, sugar, milk and milk products, chicken meat etc. - account for very small proportion of total agri- import, except in some climatically abnormal years warranting relatively larger import of a particular commodity – cereals (mostly wheat) in 1997-98, pulses in 1996-97 and 1997-98 
        8.79 It is generally the policy that import duties should be low for those sensitive essential products where there is a large domestic shortfall in production. Pulses are a typical example, where there is zero import duty. High tariff walls were raised this year for many agricultural and allied products, such as rice, wheat, millets, sugar, milk powder, apple, chicken, edible oils etc. to ally the fears of large scale dumping of such products in Indian market in view of liberalisation of import policy in respect of many such products.

       <header1>Global And Local Market in farming</header1> 

        <footer> Thanks to digital technology, the days when farmers were solely dependent on middlemen for selling off their produce is gradually giving way to more efficient and transparent systems. There was a time when farmers were removed from the local markets, let alone the global market, and were heavily exploited. Their earnings were meagre and they were ill-informed about farming and business practices.

            However, the scenario has changed today. Through the initiation of digital innovation and globalization in agriculture, farmers can be directly in touch with the market through the means of a digital platform. This predicament has benefited farmers, food retailers and processed food manufacturers as direct linkage has become possible. With access to regular market alerts regarding pricing, for example, a farmer can be better informed about the demands and prices of a product and can make informed decisions about it.</footer><br>
        <br>Indian farmers go through a lot of challenges on a daily basis to maintain a regular production system in the face of the changes in the climate, globalized domestic markets, advanced agricultural technologies, and a multitude of policies. Therefore, it will be a respite for them if an extensive market system is developed for their farming business. It will be multifaceted in the way that they will provide these farmers with information on various aspects of farming and also market access.

        Without a vibrant market, the farmers will be under continuous pressure thinking about profitability, cost, sustainability, and managing the risk of crop production. They would be forced to undervalue their produce, or worse, suffer post-harvest losses without a ready market.

            The middlemen and their role in dwindling profit among farmers

        </header1>
         <footer>The policies that came into being after the Green Revolution helped many sectors like agricultural sectors and strengthened the backbone of the economy. It led to the increase in agricultural production, reduction in the import of food grains, industrial growth, increase in productivity to satisfy market demand. However, the one aspect that went completely unnoticed by these policies is the individual income of the farmers.

            The most crucial one is the middleman who works between the farmers and the buyer and is involved in the whole transaction, and also the control that the trader cartels have over the business, as 70% of the farm produce that India makes is sold to the middlemen. The farmers sell their goods to these middlemen at a very low cost and these middlemen sell those products to the buyers at a much higher price..
            
            A very crucial challenge here is to make Indian farmers understand the value of their produce. Statistics say that the money that they receive in exchange for their produce is a meager 20% of what they should earn, which makes them unable to sustain their families by just depending on farming.

        The need for an innovation such as a digital platform that connects the farmers and the buyers 

      </header1>
       <footer>A digital platform should be created to connect the farmers and the buyers because it will try to make the two parties come together so that they can have a detailed interaction regarding each of their needs and requirements. It is being said after several studies that by 2050 food supply will have to be increased by 50-60%, and it will be no easy task.

        So to help the farmers not face the problems that they have been facing all this time, like low value for their produce, lack of good marketing schemes for their products, there is a very urgent need for the establishment of innovation such as a digital platform. These platforms will be created keeping in mind the needs of the farmers so they can improve the quality of their life.
