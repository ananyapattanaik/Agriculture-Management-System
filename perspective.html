    <header1>  Issues Related to Agriculture Supply Chains</header1>
    <footer>
      
        
        Participants in Agriculture supply chains, e.g. farmers, traders, processors, retailers, etc, understand that original good quality products can be subject to quality decay because of an inadequate action of another participant.
        
        For example, when a farm leaves a can of milk for pick-up on a roadside, under the sun, without any cover, there will be a loss of quality that may even render the raw material unfit for processing.
        
        Similarly, if processors, on the other hand, use packaging items and/or technologies that do not maintain freshness and nutritional characteristics of their products as much as possible, retailers will be likely to face customer complaints.<br>

       <header1>Supply Chain Management - Importance</header1> 

        <footer> Chain management is important because it can help achieve a variety of business goals.
        Controlling manufacturing processes, for example, can improve product quality while lowering the risk of recalls and lawsuits and assisting in the development of a strong consumer brand.
        Controls over shipping procedures can improve customer service by avoiding costly shortages or periods of inventory oversupply.
        Supply chain management allows companies to improve their profit margins in a variety of ways, and it is especially important for companies with large and international operations.
        When a country has good Supply Chain Management practises, the economy as a whole benefits.
        Farmers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers benefit from strong supply chain connections.
        Everyone in the supply chain link will receive inputs more quickly, at the right time, and at a lower cost.<br>

        Early processing-based supply chain management success included improved
        relationships between warehousing and transportation within companies as a result of
        reduced inventory and better response time to customer requests for products and services.
        Supply chain management then entered a logistics stage where other functional areas within
        companies joined forces to incorporate manufacturing, procurement, transportation,
        distribution, and marketing to effectively compete in the marketplace. This stage was aided
        by the use of telecommunications, electronic data interface, and other technological advances
        that made the transfer of information more transparent across the functional areas between
        companies.<br>

            Supply Chain Management - Working

           </header1>
            <footer>
                Supply chain management (SCM) refers to suppliers' efforts to design and implement supply chains that are as efficient and cost-effective as possible.
                Supply chains encompass everything from manufacturing to product development to the information systems required to manage these endeavours.
                SCM is based on the premise that nearly every product that enters the market is the result of the efforts of numerous organisations that comprise a supply chain.
                Although supply chains have existed for centuries, most businesses have only recently recognised them as a value-add to their operations.
                Raw materials such as grains, raw meat, and fish are collected at various locations by various sources.
                These sources may undergo preliminary processing to create components of a food product before passing them on to the main manufacturer via numerous middlemen.
                The final processing of these components to make the food product is done by the manufacturer.
                The finished product must now be delivered to the consumer. There will be a number of middlemen and stages here as well.
                Furthermore, the manufacturer typically transfers the food product to a wholesaler.
                The wholesaler sells the product to a retailer, from whom the consumer purchases the processed food item for personal consumption.
                As a result, Supply Chain Management is the management of the upstream and downstream, with value added at each stage.<br>
