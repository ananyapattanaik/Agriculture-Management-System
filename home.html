    <footer>Agribusiness, supply chain management (SCM) implies managing the relationships between the businesses responsible for the efficient production and supply of products from the farm level to the consumers to meet consumers' requirements reliably in terms of quantity, quality and price.At the most fundamental level, supply chain management (SCM) is management of the flow of goods, data, and finances related to a product or service, from the procurement of raw materials to the delivery of the product at its final destination.

        Supply chains have existed since ancient times, beginning with the very first product or service created and sold. With the advent of industrialization, SCM became more sophisticated, allowing companies to do a more efficient job of producing and delivering goods and services. For example, Henry Ford’s standardization of automobile parts was a game-changer that allowed for the mass production of goods to meet the demands of a growing customer base. Over time, incremental changes (such as the invention of computers) have brought additional levels of sophistication to SCM systems. However, for generations, SCM essentially remained a linear, siloed function that was managed by supply chain specialists.
        
        The internet, technology innovation, and the explosion of the demand-driven global economy has changed all that. Today’s supply chain is no longer a linear entity. Rather, it’s a complex collection of disparate networks that can be accessed 24 hours a day. At the center of these networks are consumers expecting their orders to be fulfilled―when they want them, the way they want them.Today’s SCM is all about the customer

        SCM has historically been about increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Although those needs haven’t changed, what has changed is that the customer is now playing a front-and-center role in setting SCM priorities. It’s been said that “customer experiences live and die in the supply chain.”<br><br><br>
        
        Customer loyalty is predicated on an enterprise being able to quickly and accurately fulfill customer expectations. Raw materials, manufacturing, logistics, and trade and order management must all be coordinated to get a given item to the customer within a reasonable timeframe. To accomplish this, companies must look at their supply chains through their customers’ eyes. It’s not simply about getting the order to the customer on time; it’s about doing everything at the right time—before, during, and after order delivery.Traceability, repudiation, and trust with blockchain

        You need to know what’s taking place in every aspect of your supply chain at all times. Intelligent SCM solutions give you that capability. When you’re considering SCM solutions, look for a system that uses blockchain to make visibility and insight easy for you by building those capabilities right into the SCM processes. This ensures traceability, repudiation, and trust throughout your supply network.
        
        The food industry in particular stands to benefit greatly from this type of SCM. For example, it’s been instrumental in helping LiDestri Food and Drink manage a very complex supply chain for increased visibility, more accurate forecasting, and greater profitability while building deeper trust between the company and its customers.
        <br><br><br>
        Today’s leading-edge SCM systems are end-to-end product suites that help businesses manage and optimize their supply chains as one complete ecosystem. Because they are fully integrated cloud technologies, these systems enable 100% visibility across the supply chain and scale up or down to react to market reality. With a modern, demand-driven supply chain, you can meet the challenges of increased customer expectations, shorter product lifecycles, and fluctuating demand.The future of SCM

        The supply chain of the future is all about responsiveness and the customer experience― understood and managed within a network rather than a linear model. Every node of the network must be attuned and flexible to the needs of the consumer while also being capable of addressing factors such as sourcing, trade policies, modes of shipment, and more.
        
        Advanced technology will increasingly be used to improve transparency and visibility throughout this network, as well as to further enable connectivity and SCM utilization. The entire SCM planning function will become more intelligent to take consumer demands into account. The ability to adapt will be a mandate.
        
        In the past, supply chain planning has been a periodic business exercise. Heading into the future, it will be continuous. Future SCM systems will also bring tighter alignment between planning and execution, which is not a current state for most enterprises. The need for speed and accuracy in SCM is only going to increase. Make sure your supply chain is ready for the future by supporting it with an intelligent SCM system.</footer>
